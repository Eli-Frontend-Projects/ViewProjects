### 2. Chat App
A single-user chat application with two versions available:

- **Fast Load (Chat Area Only)**  
  A quick-loading version allowing users to directly access the chat feature.  
  [Live Demo (Chat Area Only)](https://deploying-repo.onrender.com/)

- **Full Version (Slower Load)**  
  Includes login and signup pages. Load time is slower due to being hosted on Renderâ€™s free tier. Also uses a database.
